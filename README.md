# FS19 AutoDrive Routes


When I'm playing Farming Simulator 19 (FS19), I use AutoDrive (AD) and CoursePlay (CP).

Just to test if this works, I started this repository and put my AD routes in them.

They are as they are, complete or partially complete, but maybe you can use them for your own games.
Sometimes even with Dutch names for the destinations, but you can change them!


## Route for maps
* Stappenbach 2020

Happy farming,
