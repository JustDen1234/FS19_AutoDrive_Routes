# FS19-AutoDrive-Routes


When I'm playing Farming Simulator 19 (FS19), I use AutoDrive (AD) and CoursePlay (CP).
Just to test if this works, I started this repository and put my AD routes in them.
They are mostly far from complete, but maybe you can use them for your own games.


## Route for maps
* Stappenbach 2020


## Links
* [AutoDrive](https://github.com/Stephan-S/FS19_AutoDrive)
* [CoursePlay](https://github.com/Courseplay/courseplay) ([releases](https://github.com/Courseplay/courseplay/releases))

Happy farming,
